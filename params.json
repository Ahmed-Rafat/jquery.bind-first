{"name":"Jquery.bind-first","tagline":"Attach handler to an event and it will be executed first, regardless of how many ones you had already attached.","body":"# jQuery.bind-first\r\n\r\nbind-first is a tiny jQuery plugin for moving event handler to the beginning of the event queue so that this handler will be executed first, regardless of how many other handlers you had already attached.\r\n\r\nUsing jQuery.bind-first you may be sure that your event handler will be executed first, regardless of its actual appearance in the code.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$(/* selector */).onFirst(/* arguments  */);\t// (only jQuery >= 1.7)\r\n$(/* selector */).bindFirst(/* arguments  */);\r\n$(/* selector */).delegateFirst(/* arguments  */);\r\n$(/* selector */).liveFirst(/* arguments  */);\r\n$(/* selector */).oneFirst(/* arguments  */);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe arguments are completely identical to the corresponding jQuery functions: [bind](http://api.jquery.com/bind/), [delegate](http://api.jquery.com/delegate/), [live](http://api.jquery.com/live/), [one](http://api.jquery.com/one/) and [on](http://api.jquery.com/on/).\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('#bind a')\r\n\t// regular bind: binded first, will be runned second\r\n\t.bind('click', function() {\r\n\t\talert('regular bind');\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t})\r\n\t// bindFirst: binded second, will be runned first\r\n\t.bindFirst('click', function() {\r\n\t\talert('bindFirst');\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n### MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Vladimir Zhuravlev\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
